# 6.804 / 9.66: Computational Cognitive Science

This is the repository of our team's final project, completed in a team of 3. We investigated whether we could train agents using reinforcement learning and Baysian inference to identify cooperative, competitive, hindering, or random behavior in gameplay.

See [this writeup](https://github.com/janicey27/6.804/blob/main/9.66-Writeup.pdf) for a more detailed explanation of our process and findings, and [this notebook] (https://github.com/janicey27/6.804/blob/main/FinalProject.ipynb) for our experimental code.
